# ARANY-API

Arany, from Hungarian _gold_, is my golden path API. 
I create the project as part of my study on programming techniques and as a checkpoint in my development progress.

It is a simple REST API. I don't intend to use many different packages, so the main point is to show off how I would (maybe not how I should) implement an API.
It's a work in progress and shouldn't be seen as a template or boilerplate, however a study/draft of a REST API.
The main body must change a lot as my skills evolve. Indeed these are a list of points I would like to implement on this project:
- [] Kubernetes + Docker Deployment.
- [] Authorization via JWT.
- [] Secure Password Creation

## Why Python?

I choose python for the freedom to apply different patterns to it and also because python is my favourite programming language.

## Why Flask?

Flask is a straightforward yet powerful framework. Since it is a micro-framework, it allows me to implement certain features as needed and mix things.
I'm using some extensions:
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
